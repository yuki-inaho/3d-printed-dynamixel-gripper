# Chili3D viewing lessons

Use this reference for a local Chili3D manual capture. The following lessons were observed with v0.7.0-beta; inspect the actual local version before accessing its app state. They are presentation techniques, not changes to CAD geometry.

- `view-gizmo.cameraController.view.document.modelManager.rootNode` contains nested nodes. In this version `children()` is a method. Traverse leaves and read names; do not interpret `Array.from(node.children)` as an inventory.
- After replacing a STEP shape, preserving the XCAF occurrence name alone may leave an automatically generated STEP PRODUCT Name. This viewer uses the product name. Verify both the reimported occurrence inventory and the actual viewer names; restore only the uniquely owned replacement product, without renaming unrelated parts.
- Capture front/oblique/reverse views against a fixed coordinate contract. U/D/L/R names belong to the model, not to the screen. Measure where each relevant part actually projects before labeling it.
- A camera `lookAt()` changes camera state but may not update matrices/rendering immediately. Update camera matrices before calculating projected callout positions, request a view redraw, then capture the resulting frame.
- A screen-space projection does not prove visibility. A callout to a hidden back screw can land on the front jaw surface. Show the opposite side or explicitly name an intentionally hidden feature; inspect the final screenshot.
- For a bolt, point to its head or opening, rather than the bounding-box center halfway down its hidden shank. Derive the head axis and thickness from the actual model; do not universally assume +Y or 2 mm.
- When emphasizing newly added surfaces, preserve edge materials. Three.js line objects may also have `isMesh`; indiscriminately recoloring every such object can remove the visible boundary between parts. Save original view materials and restore them when finishing.
- Hidden motor/frame views may explain nut positions but do not prove a hand or tool can reach them during assembly. Mark those exclusions in the caption.
